<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<br />

This project is the reproduction of the 80's video game [BurgerTime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BurgerTime) playable in multiplayer (LAN or Internet).

> The object of the game is to complete a number of hamburgers while avoiding enemy foods.
>
> Each board consists of a maze of planks and ladders in which giant burger ingredients (buns, patties, lettuce/tomato, etc.) are laid out. When the player walks the full length of an ingredient, it falls to the level below, knocking down any ingredient that happens to be there. A burger is completed when all of its vertically aligned ingredients have been dropped out of the maze and onto a waiting plate, and the player must complete all burgers to finish the board.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To play the game, you have to run a server (game), while clients (human players) connect to it.

1. Start the server: run the executable and select option 1.  
2. Start one or more clients (on the same machine or not): run the same executable but select option 2.  
   On the login screen, you must type the IP address (`127.0.0.1` if the server is on the same machine) of the server to connect.

*Note: if you want to play on the Internet, you must open the TCP port `25565` on your firewall.*

**Controls:**
- <kbd>Z</kbd> to climb a ladder.
- <kbd>S</kbd> to climb down a ladder.
- <kbd>Q</kbd> to move to the left.
- <kbd>D</kbd> to move to the right.
